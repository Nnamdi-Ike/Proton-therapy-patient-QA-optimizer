# Proton-therapy-patient-QA-optimizer
Re-organizes proton therapy patient QA for shortest time...

Automatic reorganizing of large task lists is faster than manual reorganizing. 
Script allows one to adjust the time it takes to change setup conditions. Could be reworked to do this automatically with RS and .NET

Task list input has to be in "template.xlsx" format and named "input.xlsx", resulting output is named "output.xlsx"
